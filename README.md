# airflow-data-pipeline
________________

## Summary
A music streaming company, Sparkify, has decided that it is time to introduce more automation and monitoring to their data warehouse ETL pipelines and come to the conclusion that the best tool to achieve this is Apache Airflow.

The source data resides in S3 and needs to be processed in Sparkify's data warehouse in Amazon Redshift. The source datasets consist of JSON logs that tell about user activity in the application and JSON metadata about the songs the users listen to.

```

#### Change directory to local repository
```
cd airflow-data-pipeline
```

#### Create python virtual environment
```

2. Under Connections, select Create.

3. On the create connection page, enter the following values:
- Conn Id: Enter aws_credentials.
- Conn Type: Enter Amazon Web Services.
- Login: Enter your Access key ID from the IAM User credentials.
- Password: Enter your Secret access key from the IAM User credentials.
![aws_credentials](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/February/5c5aaefe_connection-aws-credentials/connection-aws-credentials.png)
Once you input these values, select Save and Add Another.

4. Next create connection page, enter the following values:
- Conn Id: Enter redshift.
- Conn Type: Enter Postgres.
- Host: Enter the endpoint of your Redshift cluster, excluding the port at the end.
- Schema: Enter dev. This is the Redshift database you want to connect to.
- Login: Enter awsuser.
- Password: Enter the password you created when launching your Redshift cluster.
- Port: Enter 5439.

Once you input these values, select Save.
### Start the DAG
Start the DAG by switching it state from OFF to ON.

Refresh the page and click on the s3_to_redshift_dag to view the current state.

The whole pipeline is supposed to take around 10 minutes to complete.
